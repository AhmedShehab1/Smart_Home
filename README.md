## Project Overview

Our project focuses on implementing a mobile-based smart home system that allows up to 10 different users to control LED lights and manage the safety door. Each user has a unique username and password for secure access. If a user enters the wrong password three times, an alarm will sound as a security measure.

## Features

1. ***User Authentication:***
   - Unique usernames and passwords for up to 10 users.
   - Three unsuccessful login attempts trigger an alarm.

2. ***LED Light Control:***
   - Users can turn the LED lights on or off using the app.

3. ***Safety Door System:***
   - Solenoid-based safety door control for added security.
   - Integration with a buzzer alarm for unauthorized access.

4. ***Bluetooth Connectivity:***
   - Utilizing HC-05 Bluetooth module for seamless communication.
